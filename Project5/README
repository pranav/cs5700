# CS5700 Project 5: Cheating BitTorrent Client

Team: ThanksObama
Members: Eric Chin, Pranav Gandhi

# Tasks

* Lie
  - Withhold information on what we have (Storage.java)
  - Tell tracker we upload more than we do (TrackerClient.java, TrackerInfo.java)
  - Throttle upload bandwidth (PeerMonitorTask.java)
  - Hide information about our identity (PeerID.java, Peer.java)
* DOS
* Other malicious things
* What do we want to do with the hashes?

* Interesting: PeerCoordinator.java
  - what's a BitField?

* Interesting: PeerCheckerTask.java (with TimerTask that checks for good/bad
  up/downloaders; works with PeerCoordinator to select which Peers get (un)choked

* Peer.java has some interesting properties (choking, download/upload info, interesting)
* PeerState.java has some things that facilitate communication. "havePiece" "cancelMessage"
* PeerCheckerTask.java deals with timing

# Notes

* Downloaded = amount we have downloaded
* Uploaded = amount we have uploaded
* Downloader = a peer downloading from us
* Uploader = me

# Questions

* so if i change the program to report that peers don't upload anything to us such that
  we're the only ones uploading, then how does that affect choking?
  - I think we may need to change this so that we know that we're *actually* downloading from someone.
* should we download only from people who give us more than we give them?
