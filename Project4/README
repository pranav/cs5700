High level overview for Raw Sockets
- Pranav Gandhi (hyfi@ccs.neu.edu)

USAGE:
./rawhttpget http://ccs.neu.edu

1. We first get the first argument of this command.
2. Then we construct an HTTP GET request with argv[1] as the vhost|path
3. We then do shoe.socket() to get a new socket
4. We then do shoe.send(GET_REQUEST) with our GET request
5. We then do shoe.recv() to receive our reply
6. We print the output of shoe.recv()

shoe.socket():
  1. This returns a socket from the OS, socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)

shoe.connect():
  This does the 3 way handshake between the server and client

shoe.send():
  This sends a psh/ack packet containing a simple get request to the server

shoe.recv():
  This does a socket.read() and gets the data from the server

We basically mirrored a small subset of the python socket library to fit our requirements


We faced a large challenge: We could not complete the TCP handshake, causing a lot of issues on our end.
Most of the code for the IP portion of the assignment is there but we could never do it due to the issues with TCP.
At least we are generating the bare minumum HTTP get request to get the web page.
