USAGE:
./rawhttpget http://ccs.neu.edu

1. We first get the first argument of this command.
2. Then we construct an HTTP GET request with argv[1] as the vhost|path
3. We then do shoe.socket() to get a new socket
4. We then do shoe.send(GET_REQUEST) with our GET request
5. We then do shoe.recv() to receive our reply
6. We print the output of shoe.recv()

shoe.socket():
  1. This returns a socket from the OS, socket.socket(AF_INET, SOCK_RAW, IPPROTO_RAW)

shoe.send(GET_REQUEST):
  1. do_handshake():
    Construct SYN
    Send SYN packet
    Receive SYN-ACK
    Send ACK
  2. Send GET_REQUEST:
    Construct TCP Packet (SYN)
    Send TCP Packet
    Receive ACK
    Receive Data

On every send, generate ip header and add to tcp packet
