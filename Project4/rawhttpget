Goals

1. Work on getting TCP to work over normal sockets. "SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_TCP"
  - choose a valid local port
  - manage sequence and acknowledgement numbers
  - perform connection setup and tear-down
  - calculate offset and checksum in each packet
  - make sure incoming packets have valid checksums and in-order sequence numbers
  - quit after a few minutes (assume timeout)
  - stop and go--send one at a time, wait for ack, send next.
  - no need to consider RTT or RTO estimation, or congestion control
  - no need to consider some reliabilility: in-order delivery, 

  - advertized window in any way we choose

2. Then implement IP over a raw socket "SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW"
  - per packet
      - version
      - header length
      - total length
      - protocol identifier
      - checksum
  - can use OS APIs to query for IP of remote HTTP server (to handle DNS requests)
    as well as IP of source machine.
  - need to check for validity of received packet headers (remote IP? checksum? 
    protocol id?)
