# Overview of Idea

1. Run ./webcrawler ...
  - socket connection to server
  - build HTTP GET to /account/login
  - respond to error codes
  - deal with two cookies we get
2. http:// fakebook 
  - HTTP POST with cookies, login
  - Receive a COOKIE
3. Attach cookie to all future communications (function for post() and get() to append cookies to our requests)
  - Request homepage
  - Get HTML page
4. Parse HTML
  - look for flags (print if flag exists)
  - crawl links
  - repeat
5. When fifth flag is found, quit
